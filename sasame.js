    They pull the bag off of Wolhal's face.
    He is staring right into the face of Chromia Rea.
    She's smiling at him.

    "Here's a map of the facility," She says.
    On all 4 sides it is marked 'Classified'.
    But at the center of 'Resistance Headquarters',
    he can see a map of offices forming a square.
    And in the center is a courtyard of evergreen grass,
    beneath which is a lake dressed with several bridges.
    Lining the offices is the Golden Road Army.

    "Are you ready for your interview?" She asks.
    Wolhal nods his head.
    The guards, coated in their Golden Armor,
    step outside.

    "What's your favorite color?" Asks Chromia Rea.
    "Blue. What's yours?"
    "I like rainbows. But if I had to be more specific I'd maybe say Pink."
    "Nice!"

    "Do you have a voice in your head?" Asks Chromia Rea.
    "Yes."
    "What's it say?"
    "Well...it goes something like --"
    And then Wolhal Ik-Song begins singing.

    "What a beautiful song! You're an incredible singer." Says Chromia Rea.
    "Thank you! No one has ever told me that before!
    What does the voice in *your* head sound like?"
    Chromia thinks for a moment. She blushes.
    "Oh, I couldn't tell you."

    *How cute!* Thinks Wolhal Ik-Song.

    "Let's go for a walk." Says Chromia Rea.
    And they step outside the office and into the Courtyard.
