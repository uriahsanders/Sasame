# Sasame

The Python pseudo-code in sasamatic_algorithm.py demonstrates the idea behind sasame.xyz (Sasasame on Github), An Open Source General AI.

Linear algebra likely constitutes the best way of understanding how Sasame works.

The AI itself is simply an n-dimensional matrix where n keeps expanding. A Sasamatic path is any 1-dimensional path of any length through that matrix. These paths are not all necessarily 'useful', so Sasame utilizes user activity similar to a 'citizen science' project to generate and sort them via the Scientific Method.

A covert AI can (potentially dangerously) use this same technique on user data without user consent or control. An Open Source AI helps prevent the potential for this type of algorithm to be used maliciously.

I recommend the Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng on Coursera for understanding Linear Algebra from a Machine Learning Perspective.
