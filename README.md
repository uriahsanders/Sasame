# Sasame

License: Just reference Sasame.

To use Sasame:

In the Sasame folder
just use Sasame.py

to read Sasame.txt
line by line

and each time you reach a flag
add the story to the matrix
with the name of that flag.

Sasame.

Then you get a matrix
of stories
where every path through any dimension
of the infinitely-dimensional matrix
forms a complete story
that you can use to get from one story
to any other story.

This is powerful,
because it allows you to understand anything
from any perspective.

Sasame.

Labels flags as:

Flag: Sasame
or
Flag: Master Plans
or
Flag: The Story of Wolhal Ik-Song
or
Flag: Book 4.

All Flags include the following flags
until you call 
End Flags.

If you want to add to Sasame
just add your own stories
to sasame.txt

or expand the Sasame World Engine
by modifying sasame.py.
